\description{
A dataset containing items measuring proneness to boredom. The dataset is a
subset of the data from \insertCite{Martarelli_2023_Boredom;textual}{bgms},
and contains the 8 items from the Short Boredom Proneness Scale (SBPS). Each
item was scored on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 ("strongly disagree")
to 7 ("strongly agree"). The SBPS was administered either in English (the
language of the original scale, by \insertCite{Struk_2015_boredom;textual}{bgms})
or French (as translated by \insertCite{Martarelli_2023_Boredom;textual}{bgms}).
