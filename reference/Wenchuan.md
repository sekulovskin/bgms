# PTSD Symptoms in Wenchuan Earthquake Survivors Who Lost a Child

This dataset contains responses to 17 items assessing symptoms of
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Chinese adults who survived the
2008 Wenchuan earthquake and lost at least one child in the disaster
(McNally et al. 2015) . Participants completed the civilian version of
the Posttraumatic Checklist, with each item corresponding to a DSM-IV
PTSD symptom. Items were rated on a 5-point Likert scale from "not at
all" to "extremely," indicating the degree to which the symptom bothered
the respondent in the past month.
