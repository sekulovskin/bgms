# Short Boredom Proneness Scale Responses

This dataset includes responses to the 8-item Short Boredom Proneness
Scale (SBPS), a self-report measure of an individual's susceptibility to
boredom (Martarelli et al. 2023) . Items were rated on a 7-point Likert
scale ranging from 1 ("strongly disagree") to 7 ("strongly agree"). The
scale was administered in either English (Struk et al. 2015) or French
(translated by (Martarelli et al. 2023) ).

## Usage
